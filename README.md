Done in 2017, based on a historic PCB I managed to obtain. Needs additional SpeedDOS style parallel cable between C64 and 1541.
Sadly we never found the corresponding C64 Kernal - if my memory serves me right, this also works with "SpeedDOS Pro" ROMs.

Documentation is a mess - as usual. Uploaded completely "as is", since I lost all interest in the Commodore community.
